Weight. 20% of final mark
What to submit:
Your assignment-related files should be included in a single .zip file (WinZip is installed and
ready to use in all CS lab machines) and only the .zip file should be submitted. The name of
the file should include your student number and 'CE202', for example: 123456CE202.zip.
The Zip file should include the following: Answers to all questions in the assignment should
be combined in one file saved either in Microsoft Word (.doc) or Portable Document Format
(.pdf) format. Text must be single-spaced 12 point Times font. Diagrams must be included in
the document itself.
1. Use-cases [30%]
Read the Cardiac Diagnosis System (CDS) description document that is included with this
assignment. This document described the requirements of a Cardiac Diagnosis System (CDS)
collected from a health care organisation.
(A) Draw a Use-Case DIAGRAM which shows functionalities that the system should
provide.
(B) Write Use-Case DESCRIPTIONS for the following use-cases:
• Register User (Healthcare Professionals and System Admins)
• Register Patient
• Collect ECG Data
• Analyse ECG Data
• Generate Report
• View Patient History
(C) Identify CANDIDATE CLASSES that can be derived from the CDS Description and the
use cases. For each candidate class determine whether it is a BOUNDARY, CONTROL or
ENTITY class.
2. Sequence Diagram [15%]
From these Use-Case DESCRIPTIONS and CANDIDATE CLASSES produce a Sequence
Diagram for the Analyse ECG Data User Case. Use the sequence diagram to model the
objects and messages involved in this scenario in the most accurate and complete way.
Clearly indicate the ordering of the messages exchanged, the name and class of each object.
3. Use the Class-Responsibility-Collaborations (CRC) technique to clarify the
responsibilities and collaborations between three classes in the object-oriented analysis
of the problem above. [15%]
4. Class diagram [40%]
Produce a CLASS DIAGRAM for this system.
(A) First produce a draft analysis class diagram, initially showing only classes and
associations.
(B) Then review your analysis class diagram and add any attributes and operations
that you think are justified by your use cases. Make reasonable assumptions and add
others that you think might be justified by other use cases not directly derived from
the description.
(C) Write a short summary reviewing the sequence and class diagrams. Particularly
identify whether your diagrams are consistent with each other and the requirements
analysis. Also describe whether you have had to impose additional requirements that
were not originally provided in the CDS description document. If this is the case,
explain what exactly these requirements are, and why you have had to impose these
additional requirements.
